Overview

This Python script serves as a simple client for VirusTotal. It processes each file in a specified directory ("TARGET"), calculates their MD5 hashes, submits these hashes to VirusTotal for analysis, and generates a report based on the responses from VirusTotal. This tool is useful for automated bulk scanning of files to detect potential malware.
